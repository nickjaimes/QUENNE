1. ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW

1.1 Core Design Philosophy

QUENNE implements a cognitive continuum where quantum, neuromorphic, and edge computing resources form a unified substrate. The architecture follows five foundational principles:

1. Quantum-Neural Correspondence: Quantum states map to cognitive states
2. Energy-Aware Computation: All operations optimized for joules-per-inference
3. Emergent Homeostasis: System self-regulates via feedback loops at all layers
4. Semantic Coherence: Information carries meaning and context intrinsically
5. Temporal Plasticity: Architecture adapts to time-critical vs. deliberative tasks
