EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: QUENNE

The Quantum-Edge-NeuroNorphic Engine

---

Vision

QUENNE represents a fundamental architectural shift in artificial intelligence, merging quantum computing, neuromorphic processing, and 6G edge intelligence into a unified, self-regulating cognitive engine. It enables autonomous, adaptive, and energy-efficient systems capable of real-time reasoning, learning, and action across distributed and dynamic environments.

The Challenge

Current AI systems are limited by:

· Rigid architectures unable to adapt in real-time
· High energy consumption from conventional compute
· Latency bottlenecks between cloud, edge, and devices
· Fragmented intelligence across disparate hardware paradigms
· Lack of true situational awareness and autonomous agency

---

The QUENNE Solution

QUENNE integrates four revolutionary layers into a seamless continuum:

1. Quantum State Inference Layer
   Enables probabilistic, parallel reasoning beyond classical logic.
2. Neuromorphic Cognition Layer
   Provides brain-like efficiency, associative memory, and continuous learning.
3. Edge-Actuated Embodiment Layer
   Delivers real-time cyber-physical interaction and low-latency response.
4. Resilience & Homeostasis Layer
   Ensures stability, security, and energy autonomy through self-regulation.
